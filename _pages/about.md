Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the University of California, Davis. I received her B.S. in digital media art from Xiamen University and her M.S. in computer science from Zhejiang University. Her research interest lies in visual analytics and information visualization. More specifically, she studies data analysis and visualization techniques to explore and exploit underlying knowledge, fact, or pattern from large text, tabular or ontological data.
